Run 'make' to build. A binary named 'dtMuxer' will be produced.

Use like so:

./dtMuxer inputFile.m4a

If 'inputFile.m4a' is a valid MPEG-4 audio file with a metadata
box (the 'meta' atom), said box will be removed and a new file
named 'inputFile.m4a-nometa.m4a' will be produced in the same
directory as the original file. The original file will never
be modified, moved, removed, or otherwise molested in any way.
